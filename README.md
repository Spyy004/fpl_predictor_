# FPL Predictor

A new Flutter application which collects data from the FPL API and goes through a bunch of if and else to give you the best playing 11 with formation and cost for a particular week.

## Additional Info

Well this project can be expanded more. If someone can help me with the authentication part then it would be great. After the authentication part, this app would become more personalized and better.
